        <h2 class="sub-heading">Insecticides </h2>
        <p class="post-text">
            They are agents used to kill or repel the insects present in a vicinity.
            The insects commonly aimed at are mosquitoes, flies, cockroaches, bugs, etc.
            These insecticides are used regularly indoors like in homes, hotels, theaters, restaurants, recreation
            clubs, and to a great extent outdoors like agriculture farms and gardens.
            Their use is inevitable as these insects cause trouble to humans and animals by the spread of dreadful
            diseases like malaria, dengue, filaria, typhoid, cholera, etc.
            In plants, they are also responsible for the spread of infections, and sometimes they cause diseases in
            plants.
        </p>



        <h2 class="sub-heading">Pesticides</h2>
        <p class="post-text">
            These are chemical agents used to kill pests on plants.
            They include insecticides, anti-mollusks, and also antimicrobial like antibacterial, antivirals, anti-fungi
            agents, etc.
            They are mostly aimed at safeguarding agriculture farms and gardens for better yield.
        </p>



        <h2 class="sub-heading">Facts on usage of pesticides and insecticides:</h2>
        <p class="post-text">
            <li>
                More than 1.1 billion pounds of pesticides are applied annually to crops in the US mostly in combination
                with seeds that are genetically engineered to withstand them.
            </li>
            <li>
                Industrial agriculture relies on two types of chemicals: fertilizers and pesticides.The former boost
                soil fertility, making crops more productive, while the latter protect crops by controlling weeds
                (herbicides), insect and animal infestation (insecticides and rodenticides) and fungal/mold diseases
                (fungicides).Despite the widespread recognition that pesticides are harmful to human and environmental
                health, our industrial agricultural system depends on their continued use.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spraying Roundup on a field of corn genetically engineered to withstand the chemical kills the weeds
                without affecting the corn.90% More than 90% of corn, soybeans and cotton in the US are genetically
                modified to be resistant to herbicides.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pesticides are a $14 billion industry in the US; two-thirds are for agricultural use.Terms to Know
                Atrazine A widely used herbicide on corn and other crops.
            </li>
            <li>
                Even more concerningly, honey bees seem to prefer food sources that contain neonic residues.Pesticide
                Resistance Another on-farm problem stemming from over-reliance on pesticides is the evolution of
                pesticide resistance in insects, weeds, and diseases.
            </li>
            <li>
                Herbicide resistance is increasingly common, and some areas may have multiple herbicide-resistant weed
                species in their fields, making weed control even more difficult.In just the US, scientists have already
                discovered 25 species of weeds that have grown resistant to herbicides.

            </li>
            <li>
                Sometimes, these new formulations contain older, more hazardous chemicals like dicamba, atrazine, and
                2,4-D.In some formulations, it can cause major health problems for farmworkers and poses serious risks
                to aquatic life.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pesticide Drift
                Depending on how they’re applied, some pesticides can drift off target and damage other crops.In this
                case, dicamba drift damaged 3.6 million acres of non-resistant soybeans in neighboring fields, as well
                as vegetables, fruits, and trees in 25 states
            </li>
            <li>
                Dicamba can drift off of fields to kill or damage neighboring farmers' crops.The damage from dicamba
                drift is widespread and has been reported in 25 states.The Impact of Pesticide Use on Public Health.Dig
                Deeper How Our Food
                System Affects Public Health Pesticides also pose serious risks to human health and safety.Because of
                their widespread use, people in every part of our food system — producers, workers and consumers — can
                be exposed to potentially harmful levels of pesticides.As part of the approval process for new
                pesticides, the EPA assesses possible health impacts, drafts usage guidelines and establishes
                tolerances, or amounts allowed on or in a food.

            </li>
            <li>
                The people most at risk from pesticides are the farmworkers who apply them and who work in the fields where they are used.Health Problems Associated with Long-Term Exposure to Pesticides In addition to acute poisoning from field exposures, pesticides can also cause longer-term health impacts for workers and consumers, and even people who live around farms where they are used.
            </li>
            <li>
                In 2015, the World Health Organization analyzed the existing research on glyphosate and classed it “probably carcinogenic,” having found some evidence of an increased prevalence for non-Hodgkin lymphoma after glyphosate exposure.So while it looks unlikely that glyphosate residues in food directly cause cancer in consumers, there’s plenty of cause for further investigation of health impacts.
            </li>
            <li>
                Limiting Pesticide Intake While USDA testing consistently finds that nearly all food samples have pesticide residues, the levels are typically well below the tolerance levels established by the EPA.Recent analysis by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) showed that 70 percent of produce samples were contaminated with pesticide residues.

            </li>
            <li>
                The type and amount of residue found on food can depend on many factors, like how the pesticides were applied, and whether or not the foods had a thick peel.What You Can Do Farming that does not rely on chemical pesticides requires more specialized knowledge, time and labor on the part of the farmer; thus, the products are often more expensive.
